MATLAB Compiler

1. Install MCR 

. Verify the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) is installed and ensure you    
  have installed version 8.1 (R2013a).   

. If the MCR is not installed, do the following:
  (1) enter
  
      >>mcrinstaller
      
      at MATLAB prompt. The MCRINSTALLER command displays the 
      location of the MCR Installer.

  (2) run the MCR Installer.

Or download the Linux 64-bit version of the MCR for R2013a from the MathWorks Web site:

2. Run CLImAT-HET softwares

"run_CLImATHET.sh" is a shell script for temporarily setting environment variables and executing CLImAT-HET programs.
Before using the shell script, users need to make it executable by using the following command:

chmod +x run_CLImATHET.sh CLImATHET CLImATHET_plot


Usage: 
./run_CLImATHET.sh <MCRDIR> <dataDir> <outputDir> <plotDir> <configFile>

Arguments:
	MCRDIR:               The directory where version 8.1 of MCR is installed or the directory where MATLAB is installed on the machine
	dataDir:              The directory containing files generated by DFExtract
	outputDir:            The directory to save CLImATHET results
	plotDir:              The directory to save the plots of every tumor sample
	configFile:           The configuration file containing user-defined parameters

Example:
	./run_CLImATHET.sh /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v81 /path/to/data /path/to/results /path/to/plots /path/to/config.txt
