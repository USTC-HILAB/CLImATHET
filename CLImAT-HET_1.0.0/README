/********** CLImAT-HET **********/

Detecting subclonal copy number alterations and loss of heterozygosity
in heterogeneous tumor samples from whole-genome sequencing data.

(1)First of all, you need to prepare input files for CLImAT-HET using DFExtract tool. 
You can download DFExtract software and learn detailed usage of it from http://bioinformatics.ustc.edu.cn/CLImAT/download.html.

(2)If you have Matlab installed in your machine, you are golden. Run CLImAT-HET according to the following instructions.

Usage: 
CLImATHET(dataDir, outputDir, configFile);
CLImATHET_plot(dataDir, outputDir, plotDir);

Arguments:
	dataDir:              The directory containing files generated by DFExtract
	outputDir:            The directory to save CLImATHET results
	plotDir:              The directory to save the plots of every tumor sample
	configFile:           The configuration file containing user-defined parameters

Example:
	CLImATHET('./data', './results', './configuration/config.txt');
	CLImATHET_plot('./data', './results', './plots');

To run CLImAT-HET on a example data, use command:
example()

(3)If Matlab is not installed in your machine, please refer to "readme.txt" 
file in "executables" directory to learn details of using CLImAT-HET.
